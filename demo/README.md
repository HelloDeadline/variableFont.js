# Demo

This folder contains a web page called VariableFontViewer.html. This page shows how to use the features of variableFont.js. You do not have to use it with a server. 

Simply save the folder locally then open VariableFontViewer.html in a compatible web browser (for example, Chrome version 62 or higher). Drag and drop a variable font onto the top section. It will change to show the axes and sliders to control the settings for the sample text. You can edit the sample text. 


## Dependency

The `lib` folder contains required dependencies (jquery and opentype.js). Be sure to use the latest versions with your real projects.

See [opentype.js](https://github.com/nodebox/opentype.js) for the latest version.
Please follow [instruction](https://github.com/nodebox/opentype.js#using-bower) on the opentype.js site to include it in your page. Opentype.js must be included before including variablefont.js in the html page. variableFont.js functions depend on opentype.js.
