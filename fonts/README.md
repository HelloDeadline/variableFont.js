# Monotype Variable Font Demos - Avenir Next™ and KairosSans™
 
These variable fonts showcase the capabilities in the new OpenType version 1.8 specification. Please read the [EULA], which limits usage for development, prototyping and testing purposes – and not for re-distribution or commercial use.

They can be used in conjunction with the VariableFontViewer.htm demo to demonstrate what the variableFont.js library, together with opentype.js, can do for your web site.
